# Metrics
Source code of my metrics scripts for Grafana.

Instruments used:
- [Raspberry Pi 4B 4gb](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) to run the scripts and power the instruments
- [Adafruit DHT22](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385) for temperature and humidity
- [Winsen MH-Z19C (with pins)](https://www.winsen-sensor.com/sensors/co2-sensor/mh-z19c.html) for carbon dioxide levels

# Why?
Honestly just because I could.  
The Pi is used for multiple things (like hosting some of my sites), not just metrics. The metrics, however, are mostly for fun.
